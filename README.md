qLibre
======

qLibre is a general accounting engine.  It's agnostic about your account hierarchy, structure or intent.  It's also agnostic regarding currency, trading units or other commodities.  Instead you can account using any units that you desire and qlibre will handle all relative values.  It can even be used to account for hours or other non currency values.

qLibre is massively inspired by the excellent [Ledger CLI](http://ledger-cli.org).  However qlibre endeavors to extend the philosophy behind Ledger to a Hypermedia API.
